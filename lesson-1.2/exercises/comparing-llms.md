# Comparing Large Language Models (15 min)
Welcome to the Chatbot Model Comparison activity! Here, you will compare the output of three different chatbot models. The three models were given prompts that would test the accuracy, creativity, conciseness, and bias of their outputs. Your job is to select the model that performed best in each category. Let's get started!

Complete the activity [here](https://igfnaqfcyl-13589482-i.codehs.me/index.html).  Then edit this page and write down your reflections here:

### Which model did you find performed best overall, and why?
I believe model A performed the best overall because the question was simply how many moons does mars have and what are their names. Model A is the only model that concisely provided the correct information, while the other two models unnecessarily went into depth. Model C more than model b.

### In which comparison category (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) did you find the models to be the most similar? What about the most different?
I think the 3 models were most similar in accuracy, they were all equally accurate but not the same in creativity or conciseness.

### Were you surprised by any of the results?
No I was not surpised by any of the results.

### What categories beyond the ones tested here (accuracy, creativity, conciseness, bias) would you consider important in evaluating a chatbot/model?
